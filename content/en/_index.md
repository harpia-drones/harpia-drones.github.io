## Our Story

UFRJ Nautilus is an autonomous vehicle competition team from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). Founded in 2016 in the Naval Engineering Department, the team began with eight students from different engineering fields. In the same year, we took part in RoboSub for the first time, becoming the first South American team ever to register for the world’s largest Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) competition.

In our debut year, we brought *Vovozão*, the first AUV fully built and funded by our members, but unfortunately, we were unable to compete due to transportation issues. The year 2017 became one of rebuilding — both the team and our AUVs. With a few sponsors and a growing group of students from multiple courses, we developed our new AUV, *BR-Hue*, which placed 27th in the 2018 competition and reached the semifinals in 2019.

During the pandemic, even in isolation, our members kept developing their projects, earning 9th place and the *Holding Steady* award at RoboSub 2020. That same year, we built our third AUV and expanded our scope — evolving from a purely underwater autonomous vehicle team into a broader autonomous vehicle team by launching a new autonomous drone project.

Today, we have over forty members from various UFRJ programs, working across five divisions: People & Management, Marketing, Electronics, Hydrodynamics & Mechanics, and Software. We remain committed to teamwork, striving to develop cutting-edge Brazilian technology that is both innovative and accessible.
