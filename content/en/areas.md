## Management Division

The Management Division is responsible for ensuring the smooth organizational functioning of UFRJ Nautilus. It oversees administrative and strategic activities that support the work of the technical teams. Our responsibilities include financial control, member registration and tracking, maintaining relationships with sponsors, and coordinating projects — always aiming for the best possible development and performance of the team.

## Electronics Division

The Electronics Division handles the maintenance and integration of all electronic components. It is responsible for designing power distribution circuits for the drone’s components, as well as creating digital logic circuits to control actuators and protect the drone. Beyond designing the circuits, the team also performs software-based circuit simulations, bench testing, and finally, PCB (Printed Circuit Board) modeling.

Throughout the project, we focus on developing circuits that can reliably supply the correct voltage and current for each component over extended periods of time. This requires applying knowledge in voltage conversion, basic electrical/electronic circuits, and reading and interpreting datasheets for essential electronic components such as diodes, voltage regulator ICs, capacitors, resistors, and operational amplifiers.

Digital logic circuits are also developed to control actuators and motors used in missions involving object capture or release. This approach simplifies the work of the software team and puts theoretical electronics knowledge into practical application.

Finally, after the design stage — including simulations and prototype testing — the PCBs are modeled in software and sent for manufacturing.

## Marketing Division

The Marketing Division acts as a bridge between the team and the public, promoting our image, securing support, and ensuring visibility for our projects. More than just sharing results, marketing plays a strategic role in communicating the team’s purpose, showcasing achievements, and attracting financial, material, and institutional resources through partnerships and sponsorships.

This division is also responsible for building and maintaining the team’s visual identity, managing social media, creating informative and visual content, and organizing events or outreach activities. By strengthening the team’s presence in academic, technological, and business environments, marketing directly contributes to our sustainability, growth, and recognition.

In addition, the division plays an important role in engaging with the public, bringing society closer to the technology and innovation we develop. This reinforces the relevance of our work and opens doors to new opportunities.

## Software Division

The Software Division is the brain behind the autonomous operation of our UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), developing the intelligence that allows the robot to navigate, perceive its surroundings, interact with objects, and make decisions independently. Our mission is to turn complex algorithms into concrete actions, ensuring the drone executes competition tasks with precision.

At the core of our system is the State Machine — a control model that manages the drone’s behavior by guiding transitions between actions such as takeoff, navigation, task execution, and landing, based on environmental conditions and mission objectives.

All communication between the software modules and the robot’s hardware is orchestrated through ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2), a framework that provides the tools and libraries needed to build complex robotic systems. To validate our algorithms safely, we use Gazebo, a simulation software that allows us to test drone behavior in a virtual environment identical to the competition setting before conducting real flights.

In short, the Software Division works closely with the Electronics and Mechanics divisions to ensure hardware and software operate in perfect harmony. This is the area that brings the robot to life and gives it autonomy, playing a key role in the team’s success in every challenge.
